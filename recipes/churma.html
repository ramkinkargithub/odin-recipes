    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Churma is a Rajasthani delicacy made from ground deep fried wheat flour
      dumplings mixed with sugar. Churma is popularly enjoyed with a traditional
      Rajasthani meal of Dal & Baati and provides great contrast with its sweet
      flavor to the whole dish.
