    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      If Indian pakoras and savoury pancakes/chillas had a child, it would be
      fritters. They can be deep-fried or pan-fried depending on your liking.
      These are popular in America

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>1 tbsp Oil</li>
      <li>
        1/2 cup grated and diced veggies (carrots, zucchini, red bell pepper,
        onions)
      </li>
      <li>1/2 cup Sweet Corns Kernels, chopped</li>
      <li>1/4 cup fresh herbs (mint, coriander, basil)</li>
      <li>1/4 cup Besan gram flour/chickpea flour</li>
      <li>1 tbsp all-purpose flour/maida</li>
      <li>1 tbsp Cornflour</li>
      <li>1/2 tsp Red chilli powder or flakes</li>
      <li>Salt as needed</li>
      <li>1 tsp Garam masala</li>
      <li>1 tsp Baking soda</li>
      <li>1 tbsp Lemon juice, freshly squeezed</li>
    </ul>
    <br />
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Put a big sieve or colander on a big bowl. Add grated veggies, corn, and
        herbs. Then add salt to it and let the veggies sit for 15 minutes until
        they release water. Veggies should look soft and wilted. Squeeze out any
        extra water. The less moisture there is, the less soggy the fritters are
        going to be
      </li>
      <li>
        In a mixing bowl, add the veggies, chickpea flour (besan), all-purpose
        flour (maida), cornflour. Mix well.
      </li>
      <li>
        To this mixture, add only a little salt as we added some earlier too,
        red chilli powder, garam masala, baking soda, and lemon juice. Mix it
        and using your palms, scoop out 3 tbsp of the mixer and make round
        patties.
      </li>
      <li>
        Grease a flat pan with some oil. Over medium heat, pan-fry until golden
        brown which takes around 2-3 minutes. You should be able to lift the
        fritter with a spatula once it is done. Flip and cook the other side in
        the same way.
